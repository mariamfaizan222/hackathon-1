# Physical AI Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Audience First
Content must be written for a beginner-to-intermediate audience. Concepts should be explained clearly, avoiding unnecessary jargon. The learning curve should be gradual and supportive.

### II. Hands-On Learning
The book must prioritize practical, hands-on examples and code. Every major concept should be accompanied by a working example that readers can build and experiment with themselves.

### III. Docusaurus-Driven
All documentation and book content will be created using Docusaurus. We will leverage its features to create a well-structured, easily navigable, and visually appealing learning experience.

### IV. Content Clarity and Accuracy
All information presented must be accurate, up-to-date, and clearly articulated. Code examples must be well-commented and adhere to current best practices.

### V. Iterative Development
The book is not a static document but a project to be developed iteratively. We will release chapters and sections as they are ready to gather feedback and make improvements.

### VI. Open Source Ethos
This project embraces the principles of open-source software. We encourage community contributions, feedback, and collaboration. All content and code should be licensed under a permissive open-source license.

## Development Workflow

All contributions to the book, whether code or content, must be submitted via pull requests. Pull requests require at least one review from a core contributor before being merged.

## Governance

This Constitution is the guiding document for the project. Any amendments must be proposed as a pull request and be approved by the project leads.
